       <h2>Delay the Transition Effect</h2>
       <p>The transition-delay property specifies a delay (in seconds) for the transition effect.At the start of the transition</p>
       <h2>Transition + Transformation</h2>
       <p>The following example adds a transition effect to the transformation:</p>
       <h1>ANIMATIONS</h1>
       <div class="anime">
        GONE
       </div>
       <p><b>Note:</b>When an animation is finished, it goes back to its original style.animation</p>
       <h1>Delay an Animation</h1>
       <p>The animation-delay property specifies a delay for the start of an animation.</p><br>
       <p>Negative values are also allowed. If using negative values, the animation will start as if it had already been playing for N seconds.</p>
       <h2>Set How Many Times an Animation Should Run</h2>
       <p>The animation-iteration-count property specifies the number of times an animation should run.</p>
       <p>This can be set to infinite</p>
       <h2>Run Animation in Reverse Direction or Alternate Cycles</h2>
       <p>The animation-direction property specifies whether an animation should be played forwards, backwards or in alternate cycles.</p>
       <p>The animation-direction property can have the following values:</p>
       <ul>
        <li>normal - The animation is played as normal (forwards). This is default</li>
        <li>reverse - The animation is played in reverse direction (backwards)</li>  
        <li>alternate - The animation is played forwards first, then backwards</li>
        <li>alternate-reverse - The animation is played backwards first, then forwards</li>     
       </ul>
       <h2>Specify the Speed Curve of the Animation</h2>
       <p>The animation-timing-function property can have the following values:</p>
       <ul>
        <li>ease - Specifies an animation with a slow start, then fast, then end slowly (this is default)</li>
        <li>linear - Specifies an animation with the same speed from start to end</li>
        <li>ease-in - Specifies an animation with a slow start</li>
        <li>ease-out - Specifies an animation with a slow end</li>
        <li>ease-in-out - Specifies an animation with a slow start and end</li>
        <li>cubic-bezier(n,n,n,n) - Lets you define your own values in a cubic-bezier function</li>
       </ul>
       <div class="wrapper">
         <div id="div11">linear</div>
         <div id="div21">ease</div>
         <div id="div31">ease-in</div>
         <div id="div41">ease-out</div>
         <div id="div51">ease-in-out</div>
        </div>
    <h2>Specify the fill-mode For an Animation</h2>
        <p>CSS animations do not affect an element before the first keyframe is played or after the last keyframe is played. The animation-fill-mode property can override this behavior.<br>
            The animation-fill-mode property specifies a style for the target element when the animation is not playing (before it starts, after it ends, or both).<br>
            The animation-fill-mode property can have the following values:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>none - Default value. Animation will not apply any styles to the element before or after it is executing</li>
            <li>forwards - The element will retain the style values that is set by the last keyframe (depends on animation-direction and animation-iteration-count)</li>
            <li>backwards - The element will get the style values that is set by the first keyframe (depends on animation-direction), and retain this during the animation-delay period</li>
            <li>both - The animation will follow the rules for both forwards and backwards, extending the animation properties in both directions</li>

        </ul>
        <h2>Amination short hand property</h2>
